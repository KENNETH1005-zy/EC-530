# GeoPoint Matcher

GeoPoint Matcher is a Python library that helps developers match each point in one array of geolocations to the closest point in another array. It is lightweight, easy to use, and leverages the Haversine formula to accurately compute great-circle distances between GPS coordinates.

## Features

- **Accurate Distance Calculation**: Uses the Haversine formula to calculate distances between two points on the Earth.
- **Efficient Point Matching**: Matches each point in one list to the closest point in another list.
- **Developer-Friendly**: Easy-to-integrate functions for geospatial applications.
- **Customizable**: Extendable for larger datasets or additional features.

## How It Works

The library calculates the great-circle distance (shortest distance on the surface of a sphere) between two geographical points given their latitude and longitude. Then, it compares distances to determine the closest match for each point.
